Lily! not changed a bit!

Covers’re all we judge books by today…
If they are shiny or not…

Every page inside is meaningful as always,
But no one’s gonna read them out again…

<p class="qoute">A smaple of the book i want to read most, <cite> Don Quixote </cite> by <em> Migule de Cervantes</em>:</p>
<blockquote cite="">
You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all the year round)
gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity
that he almost entirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports,
and even the management of his property;
and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation
go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books
of chivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get.
